        When it comes to injuries after a car accident, time treatment is of the essence. Permanent damage can occur and scar tissue can develop very quickly; in as little as 48 hours. You may not feel the symptoms right away, especially with the shock of the accident. Get the benefits of early chiropractic care after a car accident rather than wait until you experience severe pain!
