**Amino Neuro Frequency (ANF)** therapy treats inflammation which is often the underlying cause of pain and dysfunction. ANF therapy directly affects the nervous system which is great in combination with our chiropractic techniques.

Nerves are responsible for sending signals everywhere to enable function and are responsible for sensations we feel. ANF therapy involves examining nerve paths. Once we examine the nerve paths and find the cause of the disfunction, we apply the proper medical device. The first step in the therapy is to reduce pain and inflammation. Then we work to stabilize and prevent inflammation from spreading through the nervous and lymphatic systems.  

### How does Amino Neuro Frequency (ANF) Therapy work?

ANF uses a combination of frequency emitting wearable devices called ANF discs. Each disc contains a carbonized metal that is 28.4% pure metal.  Each disc is applied directly on the skin and is activated by body heat.

Areas that are damaged or otherwise not performing optimally transmit a decreased frequency.  Through nervous system signalization, ANF discs help the brain correct the errors by returning “correction signals” from the brain to other body parts.

### Why use Amino Neuro Frequency?

* To remove inflammation, toxins and free radicals
* To reduce pain by at least 50% within 20 minutes
* To increase performance, endurance and muscle range of motion
* To repair broken neuronal frequencies
* To decrease the time it takes to self heal
* To strengthen organ, gland, and lymphatic function
* To improve your quality of sleep
* To improve red blood cell production
* For 80% faster immune system regeneration

Other benefits:

* ANF is free of chemicals
* ANF is categorized as an Organic Medical Class 1 product
* ANF is CE and FDA registered
* Antibacterial

ANF discs can be safely and effectively used on babies, elderly and pregnant people.

### How long do Amino Neuro Frequency discs work?

Once applied, the ANF disc generally works for three to fives days.

After the initial 72 hours, patients return to the office 2x per week for around 2 weeks and then 1x per week (with patient having an extra set of discs to take home) once stability is reached and initial inflammation and pain has been reduced. 

### What should I expect with Amino Neuro Frequency therapy (ANF)?

If you are coming in for pain, you can expect a significant decrease during your first treatment. This therapy works on about 95% of all patients. 

### How fast does Amino Neuro Frequency work?

Sometimes it can work immediately or take about 10-20 minutes after the discs are applied. As your symptoms or condition is being addressed, you will experience less discomfort, less pain and greater well-being. The ANF discs optimize and enhance healing, decrease pain and create better function on all muscle groups, vital organs, as well as balancing hormones and systems.  They contain no chemical substance or drugs.

## ANF Benefits

### What are the benefits of ANF?

With a thorough assessment of your body we can quickly determine what physical areas are struggling and apply the appropriate disc to the area. This will begin the normalizing and regulation of the area involved.  This will help accelerate healing and de-stress the nerves and systems.
Neck pain 	Low back pain	Sciatica	Gut or Digestive Issues
Inflammation	Headaches/Migraines	Muscles & Joints	Lymphatic Issues
Acute or Chronic Pain	Shoulder Issues	Carpal Tunnel	Skin Issues
Limb pain or disfunction	Sports Injuries	Sinuses	Numbness

Any area in the body can be treated with these discs with no side effects!

## Treatment Phases

### Phase 1: Holistic pain or injury treatment

We first address the injury by applying the ANF discs in order to address inflammation and therefore reduce the pain as quickly as possible. How long the treatment will last, depends entirely on how your body responds to the therapy and how well you listen to your body. The treatment duration will also vary if you are under any medication as this may slow down the therapy’s effectiveness.

### Phase 2: In-depth focus phase

At this stage of the treatment the most common and serious inflammations show significant improvements and the number of discs to be applied is substantially reduced. The focus will now be on a more in-depth treatment of the concerned areas.

### Phase 3: Regeneration Phase

Once the inflammation is removed the regeneration of muscle, systems, tissues and organs can take place.  You will already have noticed the symptom relief but it is important that you still listen to your body.  Make sure you do not over exert yourself and push your body too much to re-injure yourself.

### Phase 4: Healthy Body In Balance & Maintenance

No more pain and the affected area is now “normalized”.  It is important to support the immune system and make sure the body remains strong.  Visits are reduced to maintenance and periodic checks to make sure your body is functioning properly and address any issues that may come up.  Since your body has been treated and is strong, most issues resolve quickly.

Duration of treatment is individually different – it can take from 1 to 4 months, depending on the nature of the problem. If there is a lot to be normalized, typically in phases, the normalization of the body can take up to 6 months.

### Are there any side effects to Amino Neuro Frequency Therapy?

No, but there can be detox symptoms:  This is because the cells eliminate waste products (toxins) once they are healed.  

That is why water is so important.  Our body does two things:

1. Makes energy from the cells

2. Detoxifies

Here is an idea of what happens to a healthy cell if attacked by free radicals:

Cells

These toxins need to be flushed out.  If you get a detox, you may experience:

    Headaches 
    Dry mouth 
    General discomfort 
    Dizziness/feeling light-headed 
    Runny nose 
    Fatigue 
    Skin reactions

Water

How to handle a detox

Sometimes a detox will happen when discs are applied.  Every body is different depending on your health history but to make it less severe, make sure you drink lots water.  Staying well-hydrated is a must! It is recommended to drink at least 1-2 glasses of water per hour until 1 hour before bedtime and to drink one extra glass of water if you have a cup of coffee/beer/wine.

What can you do to get the best results from Amino Neuro Frequency Therapy (ANF):

    Keep your body hydrated and try to drink 3 liters of water per day. (Your urine should be clear or pale yellow)
    Stay away from alcohol.
    Limit extreme physical training and listen to your body
    Have a healthy varied diet
    Get as much sleep as possible
    Avoid sugar (even fruit) because sugar increases inflammation in the body
