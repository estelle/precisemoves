Car accidents can be very serious, even if the impact wasn't high speed.  Get care as soon as possible to avoid long-term problems that may occur if left untreated. It is best to visit a chiropractor within 72 hours of any accident.

When it comes to injuries after a car accident, time is of the essence. Permanent damage can occur and scar tissue can develop very quickly without proper treatment in as little as 48 hours.  Sometimes you may not feel the symptoms right away because of the shock of the accident but when they do come, they are often severely painful and can become chronic.  

Even cars even moving at a slow speed with little impact can have large effects on your body.  Cars can weigh 4,000 lbs or more.  Having this amount of weight crash into you can shift joints, pull muscles and stretch nerves leading to symptoms.

* Decreased need for pain medications (opiates or NSAIDS): 

    Studies have shown that use of chiropractic care decreases opioid use by 50%. Treatments help relieve pain naturally.

### Tips for what to do after a car accident:

1. Stay calm:

    Take some deep breaths for about ten seconds. Having an accident will get your sympathetic nervous system activated and put you in a state of “fight or flight”. Breathing can help you think more clearly after the accident.

2. Make sure you and others are not injured:

    Move slowly to make sure you don’t injure yourself. If you are calm, your body should let you know if it is okay. If your adrenaline is going, it may not be easy to see if you are injured so slowly focus on breathing again and take it easy. If there is someone injured, don’t move them unless they are in danger of being hurt again or if the car is at risk of fire.

3. Put your hazard lights on:

    If you have time, put up warning flares, cones or triangles to make sure people know you are there and prevent any further injuries. If there are no injuries, please get out of traffic if possible and move cars out of the way to a safe place.

4. Call the police and take notes about the accident and pictures if able:

    This allows you to have the incident written down fresh after the accident when your recollection is clear. Make sure to contact your insurance company regarding damage to the car and if there is an injury let them know. Some policies have Medical Pay on them and if you don’t have it on your policy, I would suggest getting it. It covers your care after an accident.

5. Exchange insurance information:

    If the name on the auto registration and/or insurance policy is different from the name of the driver, establish the relationship of the driver to the insurance policy and get as much information as possible for the accident report. You won’t see this person again so it is key to get the information at the scene.
