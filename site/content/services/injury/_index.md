When you are injured you lose your ability to get the kind of workout you need and it affects your work and social life.   We want to get you back to doing activities that allow you to remain healthy and thrive.

Chiropractic helps by allowing better movement in your body and allowing your brain and spinal cord to send proper signals to your arms, legs, feet, shoulders, knees, elbows, wrists and any other joint in the body. The extremities then send messages back to the brain letting it know if the area is working correctly or in "danger".  

If your brain thinks you are in danger if an area of the body is not functioning correctly. The brain will either shut off or send pain signals to areas it deems not safe or in danger.  That is how our brain works.  So, it is essential to keep all of these signals working properly.  Keeping the  spine moving correctly and efficiently make sure those signals are received, not blocked or distorted and utilized properly.

### How does Chiropractic help with my limb pain? Don't they just work on necks and backs?

Neck and back pain is very common for first time patients to our office.  However, your back and neck are the trunk leading to all other functions of your body.  Movement starts with your brain and spine.  Most exercise usually involves some type of neck and spinal movement. Runners, cyclists, swimmers, CrossFit workouts and weekend warriors all have the potential to place undue stress on their neck and back.  Your body works as a unit and sometimes in sections.  Commonly, knee pain is not really the knee at all.  It is a problem with something in the kinetic chain that helps the knee move (thigh, foot, low back).  

Knee and ankle issues are prevalent in most sports but more common in running and jumping. The knee and the ankle work together in a system called the lower kinetic chain. This kinetic chain is throughout the body since our body movements involve more than one area. So...

## Kinetic Chain

The kinetic chain means that joints and areas of the body will work together and affect one another.  Here is an example:

When you are walking, the kinetic chain consists of the foot, ankle, knee, hip, lumbar spine, sacrum and pelvis.  Anytime you injure one of these structures an examination to rule out injuries in areas above and below is necessary. Even though you have an ankle injury,  checking the knee, hip and low back need to be evaluated to make sure they are working properly and not part of the problem. 

Low back pain is prevalent in almost any sport. Anytime you perform a weight bearing activity strain is placed on your spine. In the winter months we see many skiers and snowboarders with low spine related injuries from excessive twisting, turning and an occasional hard landing.

Shoulder injuries are very common these days especially with the rising amounts of postural issues due to technology. The shoulder has many muscles that are attached to it from the neck, arm, spine.  It is a very complicated joint.  It is a ball and socket joint which means it moves in many different directions and has several muscles attached that perform many different functions.  The, scapula, humerus and collar bone make up the shoulder joint with many attachments of  muscles, ligaments, tendons and a circular configuration of ligamentous tissue called your rotator cuff.   Movement involves so many different areas and injuries can be time consuming and complicated.  

rotator cuff exercises
What muscles are involved, included in the rotator cuff?

There are four muscles that are included in the rotator cuff:

- **Supraspinatus**:

    The _supraspinatus_ holds the Humerus in place and helps lift your arm

- **Infraspinatus**:

    The _infraspinatus_ helps to rotate and extend your shoulder

- **Teres Minor**:

    The _Teres Minor_ rotates the arm away from the body

- **Subscapularis**:

    The _Subscapularis_ holds the upper arm to shoulder blade, rotates the arm, holds the arm straight, and lowers the arm.

If one of these structures is injured tissue surrounding the area will work harder to keep normal movement. With time these secondary structures can breakdown causing further injury.  That is why it is necessary to figure out what is breaking down and work on not only the area involved but other areas that may be contributing to the situation. 

If you are having shoulder, wrist, arm, foot, ankle, knee, hip or low back pain, contact us.  We will not only make sure that signals are working properly from the spine all the way to the extremities but also make sure your kinetic chain is working properly by adjusting needed areas, providing soft tissue work and cold laser if necessary.  Sports chiropractors can help any joint in the body move correctly!
