(FOR EXISTING PATIENTS ONLY)

As part of your chiropractic journey, it may be necessary to address any food choices or supplementation necessary for better health and progress.  Once we have gotten your structure and movement back to the way it should be, we provide Nutritional Response TestingSM   Once we getting results, it is great for anyone who is looking for natural solutions instead of pharmaceuticals or have physical problems such as poor digestion or organ stress or toxins that are leading to conditions. 

Better food choices and natural, organic supplements may be needed for better overall health (Note: nutrition is not covered under any insurance plan).

Many health problems are because of a nutritional deficiency that is effecting your nervous system, organs and brain. Most of us take vitamins but don’t realize what nutrients our body needs most.

Using this analysis, we find out what your body needs and supply organic, non-pesticide, whole food supplements to help your body recondition itself.  We also help you along the way with diet changes to help you learn what is right for your specific body.  There are no side effects and our programs are tailored exclusively for you to restore health and vitality.

Our technique takes the guesswork out of our care.  We will identify anything that may be interfering with your glands, organs, nerves and other bodily systems on a cellular level which may be hindering your body’s ability to heal on its own.

After starting, is It Important To Stick To The Plan?

Generally chronic health problems do not suddenly develop overnight. They develop over a long period of time (often years) with improper diet (which cause nutritional deficiencies and imbalances) and environmental influences and are what have contributed to your current health condition.

Therefore, the sooner and more thoroughly you implement your program, the sooner you will start to see results. While on your program, if you continue those same old habits and routines that contributed to your current condition, your body’s condition may not improve as you hope. Total commitment to your program is strongly urged.

While you are on your own designed clinical nutrition program, you will continue on your health recovery process.

We will continue to monitor your progress and adjust your program as needed when additional layers show up. This procedure will assist you in attaining the maximum health benefits and get to the root of your health issues.
