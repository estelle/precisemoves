" Dr. Gregory is AMAZING!  I really enjoy my regular visits to see her.  My favorite part of going is not only the amazing results I feel during and after my adjustments but also because I love how personable Dr. Gregory is – she is easy to talk to and does everything she can to help me out.  I first started seeing Dr. Gregory after she came to my school to give teachers complimentary mini-massages. I informed her about how I cannot run anymore because my knees hurt after on"\

"Dr. Amie is fantastic. I have been seeing her on a weekly basis for the past year or two, and she makes my neck and back pain from computer use, texting, and carrying a heavy toddler disappear! Plus she's so kind and welcoming. I highly recommend her as a chiropractor. When I have time, I also see Gladys for a massage, and she does a great job as well."

"Dr. Gregory is a fantastic Chiropractor! I've had experience with a lot of chiropractors in my life due to lower back and neck pain and she's the best. She is such a genuine and caring person that wants to get you better and also teach you how to keep yourself healthy. I started seeing Dr. Gregory a little over a month ago. After my first visit I felt a drastic change in my mobility and I continue to get better everyday. I really like how she uses the drop table method and activator fo"

"I checked this place out because a friend of mine sees her and I work in downtown Redwood City.   I usually feel pretty good, but recently my back and neck were killing me and I was getting headaches.  During my exam, we found out that I have bad posture and my back and neck are not lined up right. Probably too much time sitting in front of the computer! I started seeing her and after only 3 visits, my headaches went away, and my back and neck pain is barely there anymore! "

"Dr. Gregory is a wonderful chiropractor. She is incredibly in tune with my chiropractic needs. When i see Dr. Gregory for an adjustment, she doesn’t do the same generic adjustment that some doctors do on every visit. She tries to find out if there is anything new that she needs to focus on that day. Her office is very conveniently located in Redwood City, and the overall atmosphere and energy in the office is relaxed and welcoming. I used to suffer from chronic headaches (4-5/ week), and thank"

"I got pretty banged up over time and had gotten used to starting the day with Tylenol 1G, had done for 20+ years. Conventional medics only offered Cortisone shots into the problem areas. Four weeks with Doc Gregory and the pills are out. She gave me a pain free shoulder, lower back, hip and neck and has made it possible for me to be comfortable training again. Can’t speak more highly than that. If you’re in pain this Doc can DO something about it!"

"I choose this place because I have had some physical problems that have actually kept me out of work and I got tired of going to my primary doctor and getting drugs and physical therapy.  It wasn’t working for me and I needed a new option.  I had headaches twice a week, couldn’t sleep at night and my shoulders and back hurt all of the time. Dr. Gregory is not only great at making you feel comfortable, but she really gets things done. After my first appointment I felt bet"

"A friend of mine told me to see Dr. Gregory after I started to get shin splints when I was running.  I love to run and was worried that I would have to stop because the pain was just getting too much to tolerate.  I now run without pain in my legs and am training to run in a marathon!  I also started bringing my son in to see her now since he is starting to play football.  He loves it!"

"Dr. Gregory is one of the most patient and knowledgeable practitioners, I have ever met. She gave me helpful tips to deal with my sciatica. I was limping around and it was painful to drive my car because a nerve was being pinched every time I sat down. She helped me heal and now I’m doing much better. Thank God for Dr. Gregory. She rocks!"

"Dr. Gregory is professional, knowledgeable and patient practitioner and very pleasant person. I came (crawled) in with severe neck/shoulder problems caused by working on computer and taking care of my 8 months old baby. She tested various muscles and nerves function, massaged and adjusted me.  I may say she have saved me, as I definitely felt better right after first visit and after 3 visits I have had great relief! She also took the time to explain everything what happened to my muscles an"

"I have had problems with my neck.  I had a pinched nerve causing my hand’s to become numb and tingle.  Dr. Gregory has made a big improvement with my problem.  At on stage of my treatment the problem was totally cured until I re-injured it at work.  Each visit the numbness gets less prominent.

" I’ve been adjusted by Dr. Amie many times and am always surprised how quick and gentle the treatments are.  She is an excellent adjuster!  She is very patient and thorough, and always willing to explain exactly what she is doing and why.  She outlined a clear plan for my care and followed it… in just a short time, I had met (and exceeded!) my expectations!I highly recommend Dr. Amie as a dedicated, ethical, and amazing chiropractor."

" I took my time finding a new chiropractor when I moved and am glad that I found Dr. Gregory.  I have been very happy with Dr. Gregory’s care.  She is an excellent doctor who is smart.  I would recommend her to anyone who cares about their spinal health as well as overall health.  My neck and back are now feeling much better.  No more headaches."

"Dr. Amie does a great job identifying problem areas and resolving them.   My prior experiences were uncomfortable and rushed.  I was concerned about going but a trusted friend referred me and with a bit of courage I decided to give Amie a try.  She not only made me comfortable and confident but she identified another problem area (right hip) and took care of that during our session too.  I will certainly recommend this chiropractor!"

" Dr. Gregory is great.  She definitely cares about your health!  I had knee and shoulder pain from playing tennis and was skeptical about chiropractic being able to help me with my problem.  I thought they only dealt with back and neck pain.  I was mistaken.  Not only has my knee and shoulder pain disappeared but I have more energy and my body moves much more efficiently.  Dr. Gregory is patient, listens to your concerns and comes up with an appropriate treatment."

"Dr. Gregory, in a nutshell, is remarkably in tune with the body and has an uncanny ability to quickly find and cater to your specific needs.  I have a terrible fear of having my toes adjusted or cracked in any way, but after a few sessions with Dr. G, I was so comfortable with her that I actually asked her to adjust my feet – a first in my lifetime of receiving chiropractic work.  I would certainly recommend Dr. Gregory to both new and veteran chiropractic patients."

" I did a number on my back while helping my daughter move into college.  I looked for a San Carlos chiropractor and found Dr. Gregory.  Wow, did she do an amazing job on my back!  I don’t know how she does it, but she’s definitely got the magic touch. I left the clinic feeling wonderful, and now I am able to operate heavy machinery and skateboard again."

"I went to see Dr. Gregory after meeting her booth at a Redwood City fair.  I had been having pain in my left elbow. I thought chiropractors only did backs, but they do all extremities… including elbows, knees and toes.  Anyhow, I went to see her in her San Carlos office (good parking, easy to get to, centrally located, nice office). She was very professional. Explained everything to me, couldn’t adjust me the first day, which was a bit annoying, but I came back for what she ca"

"If you’re looking for an ethical, excellent chiropractor in Redwood City, San Carlos or Belmont, a chiropractor who exudes professional, look no further.  You’ll find that in Dr. Amie Gregory.

"Dr. Amie is awesome. She is deeply committed to making you feel better and get you back to living your life the way you want to. What makes Dr. Amie different than most chiropractors is that she takes the time to really explain what’s happening, what she can do to help you and she will try different things until she figures out exactly what works for you. Her adjustments are gentle and precise. Make sure you ask Dr. Amie any questions you have about feet, knees and shoulders because she is an "

I appreciated the way she explained my care plan and explained everything before adjusting me. At first I went 3 times per week. She was very honest and brought me down to 2 visits per week, then to 1 visit per week, and now i am completely pain free and on monthly maintenance."

She swore by Dr. Gregory so I gave her a call. After a very thorough exam, she explained my problem and she adjusted me. I never was treated by a chiropractor before and was a bit leary of getting “cracked”. I think I saw too many karate movies…. Dr. Gregory is so easy to talk to that I felt better about it and "
